    "As was said in the seminar, it is possible to interpret the task in two ways. \n",
    "First, we can try to answer **how many times** we want to roll before the rolling. It is more difficult situation because we don't know exact realization of first several rolls.\n",
    "\n",
    "Secondly, we can try to answer should we stop **if we know what is the value of current sum $s_{k}$**. In this situation, we can calculate expected gain given $s_k$ and stop on maximal $s_k$ for which expected gain is non-negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will cover the second case.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "So the possible words are\n",
    "tuples $(Seq,T)$ where $Seq \\in \\{1,2,3,4,5,6\\}^k $ and $T \\in \\{Loaded, Fair\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "So given that $$s_k = \\sum_{i=1}^k h_i,$$\n",
    "where $h_k$ is outcome of the one rolling, we can write down outcome of our game as \n",
    "$$R_k =  s_k  X \\cdot \\mathbb{1}[s_k\\leq 20].$$\n",
    "\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 2.\n",
    "For all $s_k \\leq 14$ expected gain is equal to $\\mathbb{E}[h_k] =3,5>0$\n",
    "\n",
    "For $s_k = 15$ we can find conditional expectation our the $R_{k+1}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbb{E} [R_{k+1}|s_k=15] = \\frac{1}{6}X(16+17+18+19+20) = 15X$\n",
    "So for the case when $s_k=15$ the expected gain in 0 so we can roll or stop (e.g. any of these dexisions whould be rational and the exact choice depend on risk polisy of the player)\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbb{E} [R_{k+1}|s_k=16] = \\frac{1}{6}X(17+18+19+20) \\leq 16X.$ \n",
    "\n",
    "So we should stop rolling if we've got $s_k \\geq 16$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "The same idea as Ex.2, however, the die is loaded.\n",
    "\n",
    "For all $s_k \\leq 14$ expected gain is equal to $\\mathbb{E}[h_k] =3,5>0$\n",
    "\n",
    "For $s_k = 15$ we can find conditional expectation our the $R_{k+1}$. \n",
    "$\\mathbb{E} [R_{k+1}|s_k=15] = X\\left(\\frac{1}{12}(15+1+15+2+15+3)+\\frac{1}{12}(15+4+15+5+0)\\right) = 16X \\geq 15X $\n",
    "As our expacted gain is positive $16X - 15X = X \\geq 0 $, we should roll more. \n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbb{E} [R_{k+1}|s_k=16] = X(\\frac{17+18+19}{12}+\\frac{20}{4}) \\leq 16X.$ \n",
    "\n",
    "So we should stop rolling if we've got $s_k \\geq 16$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 4. \n",
    "We have sequence $S_1 = (1,2,6,6,4)$ and want to find its probability.\n",
    "$$P(S_1) = P(S_1|T = Loaded)P(T = Loaded)+ P(S_1|T = Fair)P(T = Fair).$$\n",
    "Now let us use the fact that rolls in our siquence are independent given that we know the type of the dice. $$P(S_1|T = Loaded) = \\prod_{i=1}^{5}P(h_i=s_i|T = Loaded)$$\n",
    "$$P(S_1) = {\\left(\\frac{1}{4}\\right)}^2{\\left(\\frac{1}{12}\\right)}^3 \\frac{1}{2}+{\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)}^5 \\frac{1}{2} = 8.24 \\cdot 10^{-5}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the same conditional independence we will get the same probability for any permutation of the original sequence, so $P(S_1)=P(S_2)= P(S_3)$.\n",
    "### Exercise 5. \n",
    "We can use Bayes rule for finding conditional probability that the dice are fair given the sequence. \n",
    " \n",
    "$$P(T = Fair | S_1) = \\frac{P(S_1| T = Fair)}{P(S_1)} = \\frac{{\\left(\\frac{1}{6}\\right)}^5 \\frac{1}{2}}{8.24 \\cdot 10^{-5}} =0.78 $$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 6. \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we should look at the $$P(h = i | S_1 ) = P(h = i | T = Loaded) P(T = Loaded| S_1 )+P(h = i | T = Fair) P(T = Fair| S_1 ) $$. \n",
    "$$P(h = i | S_1 ) = 0.78 \\frac{1}{6} +(1- 0.78) p_i, $$\n",
    "where $$p_i = \\begin{cases} 1/4, & \\mbox{if } i \\leq 3\\\\ \\frac{1}{12}, & \\mbox{if } i > 3 \\end{cases} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 7.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we will look at expected gain given any sequence $S = (h_i)_{i=1}^k$  the value of $$\\mathbb{E}[R_{k+1}|s_k=15, S ] = \\mathbb{E}[R_{k+1}|s_k=15, T = Loaded ] P(T = Loaded | S) \\\\+\\mathbb{E}[R_{k+1}|s_k=15, T = Fair ] P(T = Fair | S) = 15 Xp + 16X(1- p) \\geq 15X$$. \n",
    "\n",
    "So we should continue rolling. \n",
    "\n",
    "Whereas \n",
    "$$\\mathbb{E}[R_{k+1}|s_k=16, S ] = \\mathbb{E}[R_{k+1}|s_k=16, T = Loaded ] P(T = Loaded | S) \\\\+\\mathbb{E}[R_{k+1}|s_k=16, T = Fair ] P(T = Fair | S) = 12.3 X p + 15.16X(1- p) \\leq 16X$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "The values $\\mathbb{E}[R_{k+1}|s_k=15, T = Fair ]$  and $\\mathbb{E}[R_{k+1}|s_k=15, T = Loaded ]$ are from Exercise 2 and 3. \n",
    "\n",
    "So for **any** sequence $S$ of previous rolls we should stop when the sum is $s_k \\geq 16$."
